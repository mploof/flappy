# Flappy Bird

## Objectives

- Understanding:
  - Variable types
  - Loops
  - if / then statements
  - classes / objects
  - import statemets (using external code)

## What elements do we need for our game?

- Canvas -- A place to draw the elemets of the game
- Objects -- Not in the sense of a Python object, just the things that need to be drawn on the canvas
  - Player characters
  - Obstacles
- Logic
  - Is the player moving? Which direction?
  - Has the player passed an obstacle?
  - Has the player collided with an obstacle?
  - Has the player gone off the screen?
- State
  - What is the location of the player?
  - What are the locations of the objects?
  - What is the size of the game grid?
  - What is the player's score?
  - What is the game speed? (i.e. how much time between each frame of the game animation)
